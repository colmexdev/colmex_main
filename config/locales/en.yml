    p1: "El Colegio de México is an outstanding social science and humanities research and teaching institute and has received numerous awards since its inception in 1940. The institution operates as a small public university and research center with a highly specialized faculty, an excellent academic library and a program of high level seminars and conferences on cutting edge issues of the contemporary world as well as in many academic disciplines."
    p2: "In order to fulfill its aims, El Colegio de México carries out research and teaching in various areas of specialization. Its seven academic centers offer degrees in the following fields: Masters and Doctoral degrees in History, Sociology, Economics, Political Science, Linguistics, Literature, Asian and African Studies, Asian and African Studies, Urban Studies, Demography and Environmental Studies, a Masters Program in Gender Studies, and undergraduate degrees in International Relations, Public Administration and Economics. Other specialized courses are also regularly offered, including a series of wide-ranging and popular summer courses."
    p3: "Admission is based on open and very rigorous competition for candidates from Mexico and abroad. Virtually all accepted students obtain scholarships which require full time dedication to their academic program. El Colegio de México has numerous, ongoing academic exchanges with many high-level educational institutions around the world."
    p4: "El Colegio de México has a large library, open to the public, specializing in social sciences and humanities. Its collection consists of more than 700,000 volumes and a great amount of electronic and digital resources. The new Library annex has many seminar rooms with cutting edge technology which are used by students and professors from all over Mexico as well as international interactive seminars. The Library also has a special department of digital scholarship."
    p5: "The Department of Publications of El Colegio de México is in charge of publishing of books and journals. To date, and over a period of 75 years, the institution has published over 4,400 academic books and nine  journals, several of which are the leading publications in their fields in the Spanish-speaking world."
    p6: "Other departments of El Colegio de México include the Coordination of Computer Services and the Digital Education Program. The latter has produced hundreds of academic interviews, short courses, several <i>Moocs</i> and many academic videos on timely subjects. Thousands of graduates have graduated from the classrooms of El Colegio who excell in research, teaching, public functions and other fields of professional activity both in Mexico and in many countries of the world, particularly throughout Latin America."

    historia: "Brief history of"
    p1: "The origins of El Colegio de México are linked to the arrival of a large number of Spanish republican intellectuals who came to Mexico as a result of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). In March 1939, the President of Mexico, Lázaro Cárdenas, appointed the distinguished Mexican diplomat and intellectual, Alfonso Reyes, as director of what was then known as La Casa de España which received many of the most distinguished exiles, all formerly university professors and rectors in Spain. The institution was placed under the patronage of important Mexican functionaries, including Eduardo Villaseñor, undersecretary of Finance, in representation of the Government; Gustavo Baz, rector of the National University of Mexico; Enrique Arreguín, of the Ministry of Public Education, and Daniel Cosío Villegas, who served as secretary of the board of trustees."
    p2: "Shortly thereafter, in October 1940, El Colegio de México was established and began work on these already important foundations. The first President of the institution was Alfonso Reyes, who, for  twenty years until his death on December 27, 1959, devoted his uninterrupted energies to the cultural and academic tasks involved in supervising its early academic centers in history, literature, philology and sociology as well its already very active department of publications. Also decisive was the intelligent and energetic support of Daniel Cosío Villegas, who was Secretary General of El Colegio de México during its early years and later as second president in the years 1960 to 1963;  during his tenure the Center of International Studies was founded."
    p3: "Silvio Zavala, third president of El Colegio from 1963 to 1966  was a founding father of the Center for Historical Studies, established in 1941,  the oldest of this institution. During his brief years as president of El Colegio, Silvio Zavala gave continuity to plans drawn up by Cosio Villegas to create other centers including the Center for Asian and African Studies and to expand classrooms, library and infrastructure."
    p4: "Víctor L. Urquidi presided over El Colegio from 1966 to 1985. He was responsible for the creation in 1964 of a first Center for Economic and Demographic Studies, and then during his years as president he encouraged the development of other academic centers: the Center of Sociological Studies, the Center of Economics, the Center for Demographic Studies and Urban Development and several research programs including the Program of Gender Studies, which is now incorporated into the Center for Sociological Studies. In 1976 Víctor Urquidi supervised the inauguration of the beautiful and very functional building of El Colegio de México which has received several international and national awards: the architects were Teodoro González de León and Abraham Zabludovsky."
    p5: "Mario Ojeda was appointed president of El Colegio de México on September 20, 1985 and held this position until 1995. Founding member of the Center for International Studies, he supervised the operation of El Colegio de México and its various academic centers during a decade with a sure hand despite difficult times in terms of the national economy and national politics. During his administration major improvements were made to the institution including the construction of the fifth level of offices for professors, classrooms and seminars."
    p6: "Andrés Lira was appointed president of El Colegio de México in 1995, holding the position until September 2005. During his tenure in 1998, institutional autonomy was obtained. In December 2002 the Organic Statute of El Colegio de México was approved, which has been renewed on several occasions and can be consulted on the institutional website. In 2003 the Academic Faculty Council was launched and improvements were made to the building's infrastructure, library and general services, as well as the establishment of the institution's historical and administrative archive."
    p7: "Javier Garciadiego Dantan was appointed president of El Colegio de México from September 20, 2005 until September 19, 2015. Under his tenure the high level of performance of the institution in teaching, research and publications was maintained. The pension program was launched, which has allowed for renewal of the faculty. Substantial improvements were made in the area of computer equipment and software programs for teaching and research. Likewise, under his mandate the process of the construction of a new and very modern wing of his library was begun. The new building with facilities with top flight digital technology was inaugurated in May of 2016."
    p8: "Silvia Elena Giorguli Saucedo is the president of El Colegio de México since September 2015. She is a demographer with a doctorate from Brown University and has been a research fellow at Princeton and Stanford Universities. She coordinates research projects on international migration and was elected president of the Mexican Society of Demography (2011-2012). She has also formerly been director of the Center for Urban Demographic and Environmental Studies of El Colegio de México."
    p9: "For seven decades, the institution has gradually increased its teaching and administrative staff, as well as the number of researchers and fellows. It has also continued its prestigious publications program, with a total of more than four thousand books and academic journal volumes published. Thousands of graduates have graduated from the classrooms of El Colegio who have excelled in research, teaching, public functions and other fields of professional activity both in Mexico and in many countries of the world, particularly throughout Latin America."

      intro: "Introduction"
      p1: "El Colegio de México expresses its commitment to ensure respect for the integrity of all members of its community, as well as the products of its work and the public goods that it owns and safeguards. Due to the above, El Colegio de México has agreed to the following principles:"
      pron: "Principles:"
      p2: "El Colegio de México is committed to the preservation of a sound and healthy environment of work, research, teaching and study. Sexual harassment is intolerable, discriminatory and illegal, as it generates inacceptable difficulties for another person by making direct or indirect suggestions, invitations or propositions related to sexual activities, considered offensive. It is a denial of the rights and dignity of the other, as it contradicts the policies of equality and equal treatment and opportunities of the members of the academic community. This institution considers that this behavior is in violation of the norms that govern the community. Consequently, El Colegio de México feels aggrieved by such practices and strictly prohibits sexual harassment. The institution commits itself to adopt the actions that are necessary to prevent and correct the behaviors that violate this institutional policy."
      p3: "El Colegio de México is committed to academic integrity in all its aspects, and requires the community as a whole to respect rigorous principles of ethics, without exception. In particular, El Colegio de México strongly condemns any form of scientific or academic fraud and plagiarism, which is the attempt to present the work of others as their own, in any context. The above implies that the community and members of El Colegio de México, without exception, are obliged to attribute correctly, explicitly and punctually the authorship of texts and ideas in any written communication; The community also undertakes to always explicitly recognize the sources of information, opinions, interviews and ideas on which works, articles, books or any research products are based. The academic staff, in particular, also undertakes to explicitly and clearly recognize the contribution of assistants, assistants, students, as well as any other support received in the research."
      p4: "El Colegio de México is committed to the care of its facilities, moveable and fixed property, equipment and documentary collections of books journals and archival documents and artistic works in its possession. Members of the community, without exception, are obliged to preserve, respect and maintain such property."
